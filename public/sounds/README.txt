Place audio cue files here.

Expected file names:
- join.mp3  (played when you join or switch to a voice channel)
- leave.mp3 (played when you leave a voice channel)

Notes:
- MP3 is recommended; OGG also works. Keep files short (~200â€“400ms) for a snappy UX.
- If these files are missing or autoplay policy blocks playback, the app falls back to simple generated tones.
